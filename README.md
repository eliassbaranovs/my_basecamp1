# Welcome to My Basecamp 1

---

## Task

The project involves a modern rendition of the classic Basecamp project management application.
The app enables user & project management and has a sleek, modern UX/UI.

## Description

We used the MERN stack using Vite to build the app.
Styling done via Tailwind and components from free UI/UX libraries.
User authentification via Axios.

## Installation

open two terminals
make sure you have all the necessary packages installed

```
npm install
```

in the first terminal move to the "backend" directory and start the server

```
cd backend
npm start
```

then in the second terminal move to the "frontend" run the frontend

```
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Usage

You can register a new user or login as an existing one.
For your convenience and review purposes we've provided you with the following login credentials for an admin user:

```
username: reviewer@qwasar.io
password: admin123!
```

Logged in users may create, edit, manage and delete their projects.
Logged in admin users may, in addition to the aforementioned possibilities, also see all the other users and change the access status of other users.
